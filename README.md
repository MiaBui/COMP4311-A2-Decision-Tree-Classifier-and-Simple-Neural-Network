# COMP4311-A2-Decision-Tree-Classifier-and-Simple-Neural-Network
In this repository, Decision Tree Classifier will be implement to classify the Iris dataset into binary classes and visualize the decision tree. Then, a simple neural network is build for Iris dataset classification, observing changes in model loss and accuracy with each training epoch
